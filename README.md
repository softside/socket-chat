# socket-chat


## what`s this
This project is just copy from
[socket.io]('https://github.com/LearnBoost/socket.io') `s example
chat, 
[socket.io]('https://github.com/LearnBoost/socket.io')
,and remove some dependencies. 

## why this

For newbie on both node.js and socket.io, like me ,
when I have some interesting on socket,
I just clone
[socket.io]('https://github.com/LearnBoost/socket.io'),however,maybe I
miss somthing ,I cannot run it .when I check the code ,there is
express,jade,nib,stylues, too much stuffã€‚so remove these,give us a
clear view. so we can focus on socket.io


## todo

save the data to reids or mongodb
