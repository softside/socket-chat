# socket-chat


## What`s this
This project is just copy from
[socket.io](https://github.com/LearnBoost/socket.io) `s example
chat, and some dependencies have been removed.

## Why this

When I have some interest on socket, as a newbie on both node.js
and socket.io, I just clone socket.io. However, I cannot run chat example for I
maybe miss something. When I check the code, there are express, jade,
nib, stylues, too many stuffs. So removing these give us a clear view,
then we can focus on socket.io

## TODO

save the data to reids or mongodb
