# socket-chat


## What`s this
This projectjust copy from
[socket.io](https://github.com/LearnBoost/socket.io) `s example
chat, and some dependencies have been removed.

## Why this

When I have some interest on socket.io, I  clone socket.io. However,
as a newbie on both node.js and socket.io,I cannot run the example.
Maybe miss something. When I check the code, there are express, jade,
nib, stylues, too many stuffs. So removing these give us a clear view,
then we can focus on socket.io

## How to run

install npm ï¼Œit will install node ,too.
    npm install express -g
    npm install socket.io -g
    git clone socket-cat
    cd socket-cat
    node app.js

## TODO

save the data to reids or mongodb
